Privacy policy

In accordance with the Personal Information Protection Act, we have the following processing policies to protect users' personal information and rights and interests and to smoothly handle user complaints related to personal information.
  
Purpose of processing personal information
------------------
  
Purpose of collecting advertisement ID (AdID)
To give users more choice, we have introduced Advertising ID for Apps, a resettable identifier that can be used for advertising and analytics. This identifier serves many purposes, but it's useful for customizing the ads you want to show and understanding how your app is being used.
For example, after serving an ad, the marketer may perform contextual advertising, frequency capping, conversion tracking, reporting and security, and fraud detection.
